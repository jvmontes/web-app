# portfolio
This is a flagship project which will be the foundation of creating my own portfolio site and made available to the public.

## introduction
Hi, thanks for being here. The motivation for this project comes after years of having a Github profile with very little to show for it. After several years of working at a consulting firm, I started to feel a lack of a sense of ownership over anything that I built. I could never really attach my name to anything. I could never claim to have worked on anything and add it to my portfolio. I was a jack of all trades and master of none. 

After the COVID-19 pandemic struck our society, the effects could be felt as widespread disruptions affected all sectors of human life. The digital revolution was here. Folks who could work remotely and work anywhere were the lucky few, while those in several industries outside of tech suffered. It felt as if every man was for himself, trying to make the best out of a bad situation. 

Thankfully, I was able to eventually retain my employment, but at what cost? I knew that I needed to break out of my shell one way or another, and to help bring everybody else up with me. So, I decided to take small, incremental action. 

Start with what you know, and don't be afraid to make mistakes. Taking a single step in the wrong direction is more important than taking no steps in any direction. 

After years of practice projects following tutorials, I had a newfound passion and intention for making something for myself. 

After viewing all of these platforms that offered digital solutions through paid services, I decided that I had everything I needed to build this from scratch, on my own. 

I will build a beautifully laid out website that will tell you more about me. 

I will build integrations to my other media accounts, where I express myself creatively with music, art, and video. 

I will create an organized, documented resource as I build my digital tools using code. 

I will build something I am proud of for myself, but also for future generations.

## references
None of us get here on our own. Through various online "Work From Home" and "Bootcamp" programs I stumbled upon, I eventually came across [GeekPack](https://www.geekpack.co/free-5-day-coding-challenge). This is a course that's great for beginners, people who have very little coding experience can easily get up and running quickly just by learning some of the basics, and essentially learning how to build sites as a freelance developer for clients. 

## tools
If you're completely new to software development, don't worry. I've got you covered. 

### version control
Here is a [great article](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/git/) that covers the basics of using Github (the site you're on) and version control. 
I also like to use [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) to easily view my file changes, on top of using my computer's built in Terminal. 

### ide (integrated development environment)
Since I'm building a webapp and my stack will mainly stay in the JavaScript world, I'm using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It's just a really pretty place for me to put all the files I'm working on (which you can view up there ^) and integrates nicely with different languages, as it highlights stuff in pretty colors.
